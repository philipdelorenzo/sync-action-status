# Back Story

In my day-to-day, there are hundreds of repos that I need to content with. As an SRE, I have to bounce between all the repos in order to help build actions, deployments, etc. The issue is that, in order for me to work on the actions, in all the different repos; I have to use a lot of energy, and brain power, and engage in a lot of context switching. I also would have to consistently write PRs, and require developer's time to review _(Github Actions isn't in every developer's wheelhouse, so it's context switching for them in some cases as well)_. It didn't take long to realize that this method is actually quite expensive _(more expensive that it needed to be)_.

With a `repository_dispatch`, the SRE team can manage the actions in their own repo _(the target repo that houses the receiver actions)_, and the developers can make a call _(using the Github API)_ to the receiver _(targeting their receiver using the `event_type`)_, and run the action. The issue with this setup is that the developers need to go to another repo's actions to see the status _(the target repo)_. I looked, and looked, and looked, but couldn't find an action that handled this. I saw a decent amount of people asking for something along those lines...so I built it.
